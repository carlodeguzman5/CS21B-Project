This Program was made for the CS21B Final Project requirement. 

*Pardon the code since I was still a CS freshman when this was done. 
*I admit that everything here does not adhere to any design principle.

Battle Tanks
A multiplayer game which supports up to 4 players.
Tanks simply need to destroy each other to win.
There are power ups which spawn around the map at random positions.
Some power ups may deceive you; Some are actually traps which may put you in a bad position.
